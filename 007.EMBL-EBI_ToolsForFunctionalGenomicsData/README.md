# EMBL-EBI workshop: Tools for functional genomics data

This course will provide participants with an introduction to functional genomics resources at EMBL-EBI, in particular to ArrayExpress, one of the ELIXIR core data resources.

The course will focus on accessing and interpreting data relevant to their research areas of interests. It will also explain how to submit functional genomics data (e.g. microarray expression profiling, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq) to a public repository such as ArrayExpress and the importance of data standards for functional genomics. Activities will include interactive presentations by the trainer and practical exercises to give the trainees hands on experiences.
