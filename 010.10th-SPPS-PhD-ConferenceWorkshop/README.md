# 10th SPPS PhD Student Conference Workshop: Exploring plant gene expression in Expression Atlas

This workshop will provide participants with an introduction to functional genomics resources at EMBL-EBI, in particular to Expression Atlas, adatabase and web-service that selects, curates, re-analyses and displays gene expression data in a baseline context, e.g. to find genes expressed in different tissues in potato, and in a differential context, e.g. to find upregulated genes in response to stripe rust and powdery mildew in wheat.

The course will focus on accessing, visualising and interpreting plant gene expression analysis results with Expression Atlas. It will describe how plant microarray and RNA sequencing data is analysed and what downstream analysis we offer: gene co-expression, transcript quantification, visualisation of gene expression in a genome browser and enrichment analysis. Finally, an overview on plant data standards and how ontology annotation is used to allow efficient search via ontology-driven query expansion and to integrate data across multiple plant experiments will be also provided.

Activities will include interactive presentations by the trainer and practical exercises to give the trainees hands on experiences.
