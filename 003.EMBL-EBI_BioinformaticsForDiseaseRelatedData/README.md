# EMBL-EBI: Bioinformatics resources for exploring disease related data

This workshop will introduce students to EMBL-EBI, the databases and services it offers, and basic concepts in bioinformatics that will be of use to their research work. It will explain the role of the EBI in curating and sharing biological data with scientists around the world and introduce basics for locating relevant data and information of interest. Sessions with trainers from Ensembl, ArrayExpress/Expression Atlas and the GWAS catalogue will introduce practical skills in browsing genes and variation in a genomic context, and will show how further understanding can be gained on the location and level of gene expression across the body.
