# EMBL-EBI Bioinformatics resources for exploring functional genomics data

This course will provide participants with an introduction to functional genomics resources at EMBL-EBI, in particular to ArrayExpress (one of the ELIXIR core data resources) and Expression Atlas.
The course will focus on accessing data relevant to their areas of interests and on visualizing gene expression analysis results with Expression Atlas. It will also explain how to submit functional genomics data (e.g. microarray expression profiling, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq) to a public repository such as ArrayExpress and the importance of data standards for functional genomics.
Activities will include interactive presentations by the trainer and practical exercises to give the trainees hands on experiences.
