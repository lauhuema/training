# Training 

Training material covering the services and tools developed by the Gene Expression Team at [EMBL-EBI] [1] such as [ArrayExpress][2], [Annotare][3], [Expression Atlas][4] and Single Cell Expression Atlas [5]. All the materials were developed and presented by Laura Huerta at the following [EMBL-EBI workshops and EBI training courses][6]:
 - [EMBL-EBI: Exploring genomic, protein and chemical data, Oviedo](001.EMBL-EBI_ExploringGenomicProteinChemicalData/)
 - [Introduction to Next Generation Sequencing (October)](002.IntroductionNextGenerationSequencing/)
