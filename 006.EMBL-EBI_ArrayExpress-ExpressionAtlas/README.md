# EMBL-EBI workshop: ArrayExpress and Expression Atlas

This workshop is designed for researchers interested in learning about functional genomics data, how to access, retrieve and use the data from [Array Express][1] and hands-on experience in using [Expression Atlas][2], a resource to find information about gene and protein expression across species and biological conditions such as different tissues, cell types, developmental stages and diseases among others. This will include an overview on how gene expression data is curated and analysed in Expression Atlas and a practical activity to demonstrate how to access and visualise gene expression analysis results. These activities should help you answer questions such as ‘where is my favourite gene expressed?’ or ‘how its expression changes in a disease?’.
