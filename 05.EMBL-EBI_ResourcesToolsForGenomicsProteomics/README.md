# EMBL-EBI Bioinformatics resources for exploring functional genomics data

In this course participants, will explore EMBL-EBI data and resources for genomes, functional genomics, sequences, protein structure and function, and protein-ligand interactions. The course is divided into two parts:

Part I Genomics: The sessions focus on accessing, retrieving genomic data for a variety of organisms from Ensembl/Ensembl genome browser, functional genomics data in ArrayExpress, gene expression in Expression Atlas, and Metagenomics data available at EMBL-EBI.

Part II Proteomics: The sessions take the participants through EMBL-EBI protein resources focusing on the study of protein sequences in UniProt database, accessing functional protein classification data in InterPro, and finding and analysing macromolecular structures in PDBe.
