# EMBL-EBI workshop: Data and tools for transcriptomics and protein biology

In this course participants will explore EMBL-EBI resources for transcriptomics and protein biology applications. The sessions focus on browsing, searching and retrieving both functional genomics and protein sequence data, as well as how to classify and predict the function of novel sequences.

#### Date: Tuesday 31 July - Wednesday 1 August 2018

#### Location: University of Malta - Faculty of ICT, Room TR03, Msida,  MDS2080, Malta

#### Learning outcomes

After this course you should be able to:

- Identify and use a variety of EMBL-EBI tools to access, retrieve and export data from resources relevant to individual areas of interest.
- Browse, search and retrieve functional genomics data from ArrayExpress
- Find information on the abundance and localisation of RNA (and proteins) in different species and biological conditions.
- Explore gene co-expression and perform gene set overlap analysis.
